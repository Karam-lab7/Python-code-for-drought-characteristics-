# Python-code-for-drought-characteristics-
This code calculates drought characteristics and applies Run Theory to systematically identify and analyze drought. Run Theory, proposed by Yevjevich et al. (1967), is a widely used method for characterizing droughts. In this approach, a "run" refers to a consecutive period in a time series where all values remain below a specified threshold.
